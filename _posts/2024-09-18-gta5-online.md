Much like the story mode, finding bugs is no easy task and, in a real-world working environment, they are probably minor at their worst. However, the complexities of online play over a network in a sandbox with many other players should present me with some unique bugs compared to the game's single-player counterpart.

| After initiating mission start by pressing right on the D-pad, the game hangs for approximately 10 seconds. |
| After minimal movement and spamming the D-pad, the assumption was that the game was dropping the input in spite of the audio feedback. |
| So far unable to replicate a hang this long in this particular mission start instance. |

### Episode 1
The severity level is minor but with a medium priority level. Itâ€™s probably early days for me to be throwing out higher-than-usual ratings, so this may change as I get more bugs. But for now, I will stand by its higher priority because people usually respond negatively when they don't see almost instant feedback on their interactions, and so far the game is quite responsive. I initially thought the mission was completely inaccessible due to an unknown bug after all the spamming on the D-pad didn't do anything, and the fact that I was still in control of my character.
