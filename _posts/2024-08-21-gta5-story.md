It should come as no surprise that I am reaching to find bugs in this game. This is its third iteration since its release back in 2013, and with the power of current hardware, my job of finding issues proved difficult. But no game, no matter how old or how many times it's been reworked, is without flaws, and I am here to expose them even if the issues are trivial. However, I would not expect too many episodes to feature here, as the online mode will have its own page when I get around to it.



## Episode 1
### Gun gets stuck in aim mode and can't shoot

| After switching back to Michael from Trevor, the player is stuck in hard aim and is unable to shoot the weapon. |
| The PlayStation failed to capture all the footage, but switching weapons did not change anything despite the highlight selector showing a different weapon was equipped. |
| The issue fixed itself when switching to Trevor and back to Michael. |
| This was the only instance of this seen in the playthrough, and attempts at reproduction have failed. |



## Episode 2
### Coming soon... Just like GTA VI

### Episode 1
The severity level is moderate but with a low priority. Its rarity and the difficulties I had with reproduction are my reasons for assigning a low priority rating, but I do feel the higher severity level is warranted because in a shootout, it disables the player. Furthermore, not being able to conclusively find what caused it leaves it as a wild bug that could happen at any time, and not everyone will think to switch characters in an attempt to fix the issue. My best guess is that when Michael was A.I. controlled, I switched to him while he was hard aiming, which left me stuck in the wrong default stance. However, it still doesn't explain the gun not firing or the inability to change weapons.
