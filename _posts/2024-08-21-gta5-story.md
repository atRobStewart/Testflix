It should come as no surprise that I am reaching to find bugs in this game. This is its third iteration since its release back in 2013, and with the power of current hardware, my job of finding issues proved difficult. But no game, no matter how old or how many times it's been reworked, is without flaws, and I am here to expose them even if the issues are trivial. However, I would not expect too many episodes to feature here, as the online mode will have its own page when I get around to it.



## Episode 1
### Coming soon... just like GTA VI
