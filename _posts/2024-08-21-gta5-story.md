It should come as no surprise that I am reaching to find bugs in this game. This is its third iteration since its release back in 2013, and with the power of current hardware, my job of finding issues proved difficult. But no game, no matter how old or how many times it's been reworked, is without flaws, and I am here to expose them even if the issues are trivial. However, I would not expect too many episodes to feature here, as the online mode will have its own page when I get around to it.



## Episode 1

| After switching back to Michael from Trevor, the player is stuck in hard aim and is unable to shoot the weapon. |
| The PlayStation failed to capture all the footage, but switching weapons did not change anything despite the highlight selector showing a different weapon was equipped. |
| The issue fixed itself when switching to Trevor and back to Michael. |
| This was the only instance of this seen in the playthrough, and attempts at reproduction have failed. |



## Episode 2
### Railgun in firing range triggers wanted level

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Graphic Mode   | Mission     |

| After finishing the Railgun challenge in the firing range and quitting the shooting range, the player has a 1-star wanted level. |
| Upon exiting Ammu-Nation, the player is attacked by police and receives a 2-star wanted level before entering a vehicle. |
| The player then has to escape or die, as is expected when in the wanted state. |
| This bug is easy to replicate. |



## Episode 3
### Objects clipping and bouncing on the grounds collision boundary

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Graphic Mode   | Mission     |

| After Trevor hit the ball with a putter for a perfect shot, the distance covered does not make it halfway to the hole. | 
| Compared to all other prior holes, this outcome does not match up at all, and it did not replicate on the following two holes. | 
| It's clear that the ball snags and drags on the ground with erratic movement on both shots. | 
| Instances of this happened throughout the game, see the Episode 3 blog for more details on them. |



## Episode 4
### Car disappears off camera

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Graphic Mode   | Mission                   |

| Upon exiting Trevor's truck and obtaining the mission item, the truck disappears off-camera. |
| This happens with all protagonists from time to time, but this was the most inconvenient occurrence. |
| The truck does not appear on the minimap upon exiting, whereas personal vehicles are usually shown. |
| Unable to consistently replicate. |

### Episode 1
The severity level is **moderate** but with a **low** priority. Its rarity and the difficulties I had with reproduction are my reasons for assigning a low priority rating, but I do feel the higher severity level is warranted because in a shootout, it disables the player. Furthermore, not being able to conclusively find what caused it leaves it as a wild bug that could happen at any time, and not everyone will think to switch characters in an attempt to fix the issue. My best guess is that when Michael was A.I. controlled, I switched to him while he was hard aiming, which left me stuck in the wrong default stance. However, it still doesn't explain the gun not firing or the inability to change weapons.

### Episode 2
The severity level is **moderate** with a **medium** priority. I would have opted to keep its priority low, but the ease of replication warrants more attention. It is isolated to the Railgun and is only an issue in this challenge, but compared to the other bugs I've found in this game, this one rates higher as it does disrupt the expected gameplay upon exiting the firing range.

### Episode 3
The severity level is **minor** but with a **medium** priority. Initially, I rated this issue as cosmetic due to its random occurrences that can happen anywhere, then upgraded it to trivial as I encountered more instances. The most common issue was other cars clipping into the ground and bouncing back up, which was nothing more than distracting. Another instance occurred in flight school when my plane was embedded in the ground, barring the wings, but it returned to a normal state once I gained control. The last unique occurrence was an NPC struggling to settle on the surface of deep water after emerging from a deep dive; he jumped around erratically before completely floating out of the water and then dropping back in to a settled position. The fact that this issue directly affected my gameplay during golf is why I rated it as minor and assigned a medium priority, as it happens frequently enough if you're paying attention.

Note that I do have footage of the other instances, but I'm opting not to upload them to avoid repetition in the episodes. However, I can provide them if requested.

### Episode 4
The severity level is **minor** but with a **medium** priority. I was able to escape with a golf buggy and complete the mission successfully, otherwise, I would have rated the severity higher. I'll also note that Trevor's truck remained unobtainable until I reset the game, though this isn’t too inconvenient in a game titled Grand Theft Auto. Since this issue happens from time to time across all three protagonists, I do believe it deserves some attention. While it’s an inconvenience when it occurs, and can be frustrating, it doesn’t break the game.
