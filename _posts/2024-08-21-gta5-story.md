It should come as no surprise that I am reaching to find bugs in this game. This is its third iteration since its release back in 2013, and with the power of current hardware, my job of finding issues proved difficult. But no game, no matter how old or how many times it's been reworked, is without flaws, and I am here to expose them even if the issues are trivial. However, I would not expect too many episodes to feature here, as the online mode will have its own page when I get around to it.



## Episode 1

| After switching back to Michael from Trevor, the player is stuck in hard aim and is unable to shoot the weapon. |
| The PlayStation failed to capture all the footage, but switching weapons did not change anything despite the highlight selector showing a different weapon was equipped. |
| The issue fixed itself when switching to Trevor and back to Michael. |
| This was the only instance of this seen in the playthrough, and attempts at reproduction have failed. |

| After finishing the Railgun challenge in the firing range and quitting the shooting range, the player has a 1-star wanted level. |
| Upon exiting Ammu-Nation, the player is attacked by police and receives a 2-star wanted level before entering a vehicle. |
| The player then has to escape or die, as is expected when in the wanted state. |
| This bug is easy to replicate. |

| After Trevor hit the ball with a putter for a perfect shot, the distance covered does not make it halfway to the hole. | 
| Compared to all other prior holes, this outcome does not match up at all, and it did not replicate on the following two holes. | 
| It's clear that the ball snags and drags on the ground with erratic movement on both shots. | 
| Instances of this happened throughout the game, see the Episode 3 blog for more details on them. |



## Episode 4

| Upon exiting Trevor's truck and obtaining the mission item, the truck disappears off-camera. |
| This happens with all protagonists from time to time, but this was the most inconvenient occurrence. |
| The truck does not appear on the minimap upon exiting, whereas personal vehicles are usually shown. |
| Unable to consistently replicate. |



## Episode 5
### Breakable barrier does not break

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Graphic Mode   | Mission   |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------- | --------- |
| PlayStation 5 | v24.05-09.60.00 | 1.68     | Performance RT | Free Roam |

| When attempting to exit the airport via the security checkpoint, the vehicle bounces off the security barrier. | 
| These barriers should shatter even at relatively low speeds compared to what is shown in the video. | 
| It is easy enough to replicate but requires reasonably accurate timing and vehicle speed. |



## Episode 6
### NPC dialogue sound cuts out

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Graphic Mode   | Mission       |

| While Franklin is entering the house, Tracey's Dialogue cuts out. |
| Additionally, Jimmy's Dialogue cuts out when the "Retrieve the car" mission text appears. | 
| Unable to replicate on repeated attempts through mission replay. |



## Episode 7
### Delayed light and graphic rendering

| While running from the police in Los Santos at night, the lights on the building suddenly render. |
| Plenty of daytime graphic rendering issues likely due to level of detail changes, but there are no captures. |
| Both of these issues are by far the most common bugs in the game, this may be due to performance RT being the graphic option. |
| Their frequency makes passive replication easy, though deliberate is surprisingly challenging. |



## Episode 8
### Money reduction from purchase stuck on screen

| After purchasing an item in Los Santos Customs, the red -$700 charge notification stays in the top right corner.  |
| Finishing the mission, pausing the game, and switching characters didn't fix it. |
| A fix was found but not captured, after opening the weapon wheel, choosing a weapon, closing it, and pausing the game, the notification disappeared. |
| Could not replicate this. | 



## Episode 9
### Sudden changing water levels

| After completing the mission Friend Request, Jimmy suddenly appears sitting at the dining room table. | 
| Attempts to replicate were unsuccessful through mission replay. | 
| It may replicate on a first playthrough file, but this is not feasible to test. |

| While fleeing Merryweather mercenaries, the NPCs controlling the boats beach themselves rather than routing around the landmass. | 
| Didn't attempt to replicate, but watching other playthroughs shows that it happens and not just to the boats in this video. |


## Blog

### Episode 1
The severity level is **moderate** but with a **low** priority. Its rarity and the difficulties I had with reproduction are my reasons for assigning a low priority rating, but I do feel the higher severity level is warranted because in a shootout, it disables the player. Furthermore, not being able to conclusively find what caused it leaves it as a wild bug that could happen at any time, and not everyone will think to switch characters in an attempt to fix the issue. My best guess is that when Michael was A.I. controlled, I switched to him while he was hard aiming, which left me stuck in the wrong default stance. However, it still doesn't explain the gun not firing or the inability to change weapons.

### Episode 2
The severity level is **moderate** with a **medium** priority. I would have opted to keep its priority low, but the ease of replication warrants more attention. It is isolated to the Railgun and is only an issue in this challenge, but compared to the other bugs I've found in this game, this one rates higher as it does disrupt the expected gameplay upon exiting the firing range.

### Episode 3
The severity level is **minor** but with a **medium** priority. Initially, I rated this issue as cosmetic due to its random occurrences that can happen anywhere, then upgraded it to trivial as I encountered more instances. The most common issue was other cars clipping into the ground and bouncing back up, which was nothing more than distracting. Another instance occurred in flight school when my plane was embedded in the ground, barring the wings, but it returned to a normal state once I gained control. The last unique occurrence was an NPC struggling to settle on the surface of deep water after emerging from a deep dive; he jumped around erratically before completely floating out of the water and then dropping back in to a settled position. The fact that this issue directly affected my gameplay during golf is why I rated it as minor and assigned a medium priority, as it happens frequently enough if you're paying attention.

Note that I do have footage of the other instances, but I'm opting not to upload them to avoid repetition in the episodes. However, I can provide them if requested.

### Episode 4
The severity level is **minor** but with a **medium** priority. I was able to escape with a golf buggy and complete the mission successfully, otherwise, I would have rated the severity higher. I'll also note that Trevor's truck remained unobtainable until I reset the game, though this isn’t too inconvenient in a game titled Grand Theft Auto. Since this issue happens from time to time across all three protagonists, I do believe it deserves some attention. While it’s an inconvenience when it occurs, and can be frustrating, it doesn’t break the game.

### Episode 5
The severity level is **minor** with a **low** priority. After discovering how to replicate it, I felt it warranted lower ratings as it requires precise timing and a consistent speed. As a result, it is difficult to stumble upon in most vehicles. It appears that if you hit the barrier just as it starts to raise, it becomes invincible. At no other point, whether stationary or further along its path of movement, does the barrier exhibit this invincibility. Additionally, this issue was found while I was pursuing the Three Man Army trophy, and at no point did it cause any inconvenience during missions.

### Episode 6
The severity level is **trivial** with a **low** priority. We're scraping the bottom of the barrel from this episode onwards. I was happy to find a sound issue to fill out my bingo card of teams I'll be annoying, but it was the only real issue I encountered with sound during my playthrough where I lost character dialogue. The fact that I couldn't replicate it through mission replay while pursuing gold medals almost makes it not worth reporting, but it could replicate on new game instances during a first playthrough, so it might be worth exploring on a slow workday.

### Episode 7
The severity level is **cosmetic** but with a **high** priority. The severity, I'm sure, comes as no surprise considering lighting and graphical issues exist in almost every major game that challenges the hardware it's running on. But I’m sure there’s a question as to why the high priority. My rationale is frequency, not once have I played through a session where I didn’t see latent graphics or lights rendering. While its effect on me or game performance is negligible, I feel it should be looked into with haste. I’m sure using ray tracing on a system that isn’t really designed for it is playing a huge part, with the only fix being to switch it off, but I’ll stand by my high priority rating on an otherwise less-than-trivial issue.

### Episode 8
The severity level is **cosmetic** with a **low** priority. This bug was impossible to replicate despite repeated attempts and may be mission-dependent. I was surprised by the steps needed to fix it. I paused the game around the 1:54 mark in the video, and that didn’t resolve the issue, which surprised me because pausing and resuming worked after selecting a weapon. It seemed that opening the weapon wheel, selecting a weapon to display the ammo in the top right, then immediately pausing and resuming, caused my current money value to appear and cleared the red negative value. I’m sure a soft reset or exiting to the main menu would also fix it. While I found this bug interesting, it’s essentially a non-issue due to its low UI impact and the difficulty of replication.

### Episode 9
The severity level is **trivial** with a **low** priority. This almost made it into the bonus "Is it a bug, feature, or Easter egg?" section because I was unsure if it was intentional. After watching a video of someone else finding the part, I noticed that the water level remained at the lower level throughout their interaction. Revisiting the area myself on multiple occasions showed that the water level stayed low. As far as I'm aware, GTA V doesn't have a moon cycle that affects the tide. This is why I decided to include it in the main episodes rather than the "unsure bonuses" or leave it out entirely, it was a tough call.

### Episode 10
The severity level is **cosmetic** with a **low** priority. Not much to say, Jimmy loading in like that is certainly a bug, but it doesn't affect gameplay or the mission completion. The worst it did to me was make me do a double take. I couldn't replicate it on repeated playthroughs of the mission through mission replay while hunting its gold medal.

### Episode 11
The severity level is **cosmetic** with a **low** priority. I almost left this out because you can rationalise that the enemies will take any risk to bring you down. However, recklessly sailing their boat into land, leaving themselves vulnerable rather than just routing around it, doesn't seem like a good choice. So, I'm assuming there's questionable pathfinding happening in this mission.







## Bonus Episodes
### Feature, bug, or easter egg


### Episode (a)
### Humanoid figure vanishes

| While seeking out the three fleeing targets, I spotted a still humanoid figure that suddenly vanished after a few seconds. Initially, I thought one of the targets had bugged out, but I realised this wasn’t the case after I finished the mission. My follow-up thought was that it might be a nod to the sasquatch rumours from GTA San Andreas or a reference to the sasquatch in Red Dead Redemption during the mission "The Last of its Kind." However, my primary suspicion is that it's a prelude to "The Last One" Strangers and Freaks mission, which unlocks after achieving 100% completion in story mode. | 
| I'm declaring this to be an **easter egg**. |



### Episode (b)
### Mission marker disappears on character switch

| While approaching a mission with Franklin, I switched to Trevor briefly and then returned to Franklin. Upon returning, I noticed that his mission marker had vanished and wouldn't reappear until I left the immediate area. This is easy to replicate by following the steps I've outlined, which leads me to believe it might be a feature to prevent accidental mission starts. However, it feels like a bug due to the inconvenience it causes, especially considering I wasn’t that close to the mission's starting point. |
| It's a tough one but I'm declaring it a **feature**. |
| Bonus bug in this video, Franklin's Aunt's dialogue audio doesn't change when you enter the same room as her, she continues to sound like she's on the other side of a wall. |
