My time with this game is still fresh, but so far, I find my cognitive dissonance being challenged. The game itself is solid, and I’ve experienced virtually no issues with online play, I have yet to experience even slight lag. That being said, the UI leaves much to be desired; it’s quite busy and can be buggy at times. The same goes for in-game cutscenes. So, the episodes for this will be mainly trivial with a few personal gripes, but I hope more gameplay will bring better material.


## Episode 1

| After accepting a game invite via the Xbox interface, you can no longer open the friends list with RS. |
| Other functionality is unaffected, but you can see the friends list rapidly appearing and disappearing when spamming the RS button. |
| So far, not able to replicate as you need other players to test. |
| It did not prevent the lobby leader from starting a game with all lobby members. |
| Note the the Xbox UI does not get captured when using their built-in capture software. |



## Episode 2
### Bad player respawns

| Platform      | Firmware/OS Version | Lobby ID             | Game mode       | Map      |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Xbox Series X | 10.0.25398.4910     | 10388482086030226095 | Team Deathmatch | Shipment |

| Bug Severity | Priority level |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Trivial      | Medium         |

| After respawning, both enemy and allied players spawn within the same spawn area. |
| This causes an easy kill to be executed but is followed by an immediate death. |
| While the map design is intended to be chaotic, this kind of uncontrolled spawning will cause player frustration. |
| This happens many times throughout the game mode's runtime. |

### Episode 1
The severity level is **minor** with a **low** priority level. I considered giving it a higher severity level because it is an issue that directly affects the player's interaction, but it didn't stop the flow of gameplay and didn't prevent me from navigating the menu or accessing other submenus like the custom class one. Furthermore, the lobby leader was able to start a game with no issue.

### Episode 2
The severity level is **trivial** but with a **medium** priority level. This is a tough one to rate—the game is working as intended, so strictly speaking, there is no real bug here. I could argue that enemies should be blocked from spawning in close proximity to you, but the counterargument is how small the Shipment map is and how easy it would be for a team to block out the enemy team from spawning. That said, I do think it needs a rework, which is why I gave it a medium priority. The chaos is the idea, but it goes against the flow of every other map. A slight increase in size could be all that's needed to make the spawning fall more in line with other maps.
