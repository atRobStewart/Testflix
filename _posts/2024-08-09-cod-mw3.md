My time with this game is still fresh, but so far, I find my cognitive dissonance being challenged. The game itself is solid, and I’ve experienced virtually no issues with online play, I have yet to experience even slight lag. That being said, the UI leaves much to be desired; it’s quite busy and can be buggy at times. The same goes for in-game cutscenes. So, the episodes for this will be mainly trivial with a few personal gripes, but I hope more gameplay will bring better material.

| After accepting a game invite via the Xbox interface, you can no longer open the friends list with RS. |
| Other functionality is unaffected, but you can see the friends list rapidly appearing and disappearing when spamming the RS button. |
| So far, not able to replicate as you need other players to test. |
| It did not prevent the lobby leader from starting a game with all lobby members. |
| Note the the Xbox UI does not get captured when using their built-in capture software. |

### Episode 1
The severity level is minor with a low priority level. I considered giving it a higher severity level because it is an issue that directly affects the player's interaction, but it didn't stop the flow of gameplay and didn't prevent me from navigating the menu or accessing other submenus like the custom class one. Furthermore, the lobby leader was able to start a game with no issue.
