Except for regular frame drops despite playing in performance mode, Final Fantasy XVI was a solid game even just two months after its release. There are quite a few episodes featured, but the majority of the bugs found are minor, questionable, and nitpicking.

| Description |
| :-- |
| The third sentence of Vivian's dialogue has a smaller font size compared to the rest, even though the first sentence has close to the same number of characters. |
| I never saw this inconsistency in other NPCs' dialogue, regardless of how many characters each sentence contained. |
| If you re-enter the chat option and restart the dialogue, the text size remains inconsistent. |



## Episode 2
### Framerate drops

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Main Mission    | Side Mission            |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| PlayStation 5 | v23.01-07.61.00 | 1.03     | After the Storm | The Root of the Problem |

| Bug Severity | Priority level | Location      |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| Moderate     | Medium         | Martha's Rest |

| While in performance mode, which should reliably support a solid 60fps in 1920 x 1080p resolution, the game experiences regular frame drops. |
| Additionally, in quality mode, the game runs at 30fps with 3840 x 2160p resolution. The performance is consistent throughout, but it doesn't feel smooth, and the camera movement always feels rough and dragged. |



## Episode 3
### Jump instead of interact

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Main Mission      | Sub Mission         |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| PlayStation 5 | v23.01-07.61.00 | 1.03     | Out of the Shadow | Letting off Steam I |

| Bug Severity | Priority level | Location        |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Minor        | low            | The Dalimil Inn |

| While sprinting, any time you attempt to interact with an interactable object, Clive jumps first, causing you to press the interact button again. |



## Episode 4
### Graphical mesh glitch

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Main Mission | Sub Mission           |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| PlayStation 5 | v23.01-07.61.00 | 1.03     | Onward       | Blacksmith's Blues II |

| Bug Severity | Priority level | Location                |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Cosmetic     | low            | The Dhalemkian Republic |

| While traversing the desert on chocobo back, the shadow effect that appears to the left of Clive reveals what looks to be a wire mesh pattern. |
| Note that it may be difficult to make out in the recording, on my own laptop it is not as clear as it was on my TV. |



## Episode 5
### Slowly cornered

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software | Main Mission | Location                |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| PlayStation 5 | v23.01-07.61.00 | 1.03     | Onward       | The Dhalemkian Republic |

| Bug Severity | Priority level |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Minor        | Low            |

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOkvq59KujA?si=l6KDIG3jORaIjrvW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

| Description |
| :-- |
| While attacking the Desert Djinn I got slowly cornered with no way out. This happened due to a combination of the enemy pressing its attack and me pulling him closer to me with the Deadly Embrace stagger attack. |
| It's a slow build but at the 40 second mark in the video you can see that I am clearly trapped with no way out. |
| This causes the camera to push in from its usual resting distance to being right on top of the action scene. This causes the enemy to no longer render on camera and makes Clive difficult to as well as making the overall fight tougher to beat. |
| I failed to move the camera around 180 degrees roughly to where my allies were standing, but I do suspect that the camera would have returned to its usual distance from Clive. |



## Episode 6
### Coming Soon!

## Blog

### Episode 1
This severity level is **cosmetic** with a **low** priority. It's a small bug that many probably won't notice, so I've given it the lowest score. It's also the only instance I caught in my entire playthrough. 

### Episode 2
I have to give this issue a **moderate** severity rating with a **medium** priority. The frame drops are very common and occur almost anywhere in the game. This lack of performance can be a deal-breaker for many, and it always grabs my attention anytime it happens, taking me out of my enjoyment of the game. While it doesn't break the game or hinder any functionality, solid 60fps at 1080p should be a basic standard for any game on these modern systems. It is expected by the majority of gamers, especially when playing AAA games. The quality mode should also not be ignored; its 30fps should feel as smooth as Baldur's Gate 3, which runs at a solid and smooth 30fps at 2560 x 1440p in split-screen mode.

### Episode 3
Declaring this as a bug is debatable because if you look closely, the button prompt is shaded out, and the mission marker has a cross through it to indicate that you can't interact with it while sprinting. This implies it's an intentional design, but the question is, is it a good design? For me and a few others that I've spoken to about this, we have found this feature to be a frustrating one. I do feel like the player should be able to interact with these elements directly from a sprint. The need to manually stop seems redundant when you could program Clive to automatically stop once an interaction is initiated, or in the case of this particular item, just pick it up while continuing the sprint and cancel the pickup animation. To bring attention to it, I would give it a **minor** severity score with a **low** priority because it's just a minor inconvenience and doesn't disrupt the game flow too much.

### Episode 4
As this is a graphical glitch, I would have to give the lowest severity rating of **cosmetic** along with a **low** priority. Furthermore, I failed to replicate this bug even after reloading the mission and the game. Initially, I would apply the Ostrich Algorithm but I do feel it should be investigated once bugs with higher severity and priority scores have been fixed. 

### Episode 5
Another difficult issue that has grounds for debate, the player controlled camera doesn't usually clip through a solid surface in any game in third person otherwise the surface in question would blind the player. This situation I get stuck in is also happened by pure chance, it's not likely to happen too often and I don't feel it's worth serious investigation. Never the less it should be reported and I'll give it a severity rating of **minor** with a **low** priority, but I feel it's an issue for the Ostrich Algorithm.
