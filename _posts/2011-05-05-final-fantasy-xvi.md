Except for regular frame drops despite playing in performance mode, Final Fantasy XVI was a solid game even just two months after its release. There are quite a few episodes featured, but the majority of the bugs found are minor, questionable, and nitpicking.

## Episode 1
### Text Size Change

Description:
* The third sentence of Vivian's dialogue has a smaller font size compared to the rest, even though the first sentence has close to the same number of characters.
* I never saw this inconsistency in other NPCs' dialogue, regardless of how many characters each sentence contained.
* If you re-enter the chat option and restart the dialogue, the text size remains inconsistent.

This severity level is **cosmetic** with a **low** priority. It's a small bug that many probably won't notice, so I've given it the lowest score. It's also the only instance I caught in my entire playthrough.
