The following are bugs and glitches I found during my playthrough of Crisis Core. As this is a remaster of an older game, it is very robust and difficult to break. I had already spent over 40 hours playing before the first of the two notable bugs were found.

## Episode 1
### Darkness Screen Overlay Bug
Platform: Playstation 5 <br>
Firmware version number: v23.01-07.60.00 <br>
Software version number: 1.02 Release (21/12/2022) <br>

Description:
 * While in combat with enemies capable of using the Ultima attack, if I time my Darkness attack to execute simultaneously with the enemy's Ultima, the Darkness overlay effect will remain on screen after the battle.
 * All enemies must be defeated for this to happen, causing the battle to end at the same time the moves execute.
 * This is replicable but difficult to achieve as it requires frame-perfect timing. I succeeded in replicating it only once.
 * The effect gets removed at the start of a new battle or when loading into a new area.

 Severity level is **minor**, this does not break the game or cause any other negative effects. Furthermore, it can be fixed by the player without having to do anything drastic like restarting the game.
