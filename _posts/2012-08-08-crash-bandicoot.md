This is a single episode from the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, and it's the only clip I recorded from both my playthroughs. These playthroughs took place on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on the game's respective launch dates in 2017 and 2018.

Description:
* As I reach the top of this vertical platforming section, I make contact with the geometry of the horizontal section. However, I misjudged my jump and didn't land on the flat surface.
* The camera switches from the vertically scrolling camera to the horizontally scrolling one as expected. However, when I fall back down, the camera does not switch back to the vertical one.
* This caused me to lose sight of Crash, leaving me with no choice but to move him around until I hit a fatal hazard. If I couldn't kill Crash, I would have to exit the level via the start menu.
* The camera should smoothly switch between the horizontal and Vertical cameras as these particular levels were designed with backtracking in mind for completionists.

The severity level of this is minor but with a medium priority, dying this close to a checkpoint through no fault of your own is frustrating. The fall would be easily recoverable if the camera followed down. Recalling this in my own memory is impossible because it's from July 2018, but going by the video, it looks like a pixel-perfect bug that may only be doable in this version of Crash 1 thanks to Vicarious Visions updating both the first and second Crash with Crash 3 physics and geometry improvements. The game still runs on the 1.06 version update deeming the trilogy to be complete so I may go back someday and try and replicate this bug.
