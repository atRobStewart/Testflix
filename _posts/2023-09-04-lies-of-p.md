This season of Lies of P will highlight the bugs and glitches I discovered during my first playthrough and the following two completion runs. Throughout my time playing the game, it received one patch, moving it from version 1.1.0.0 to version 1.2.0.0. 
Lies of P has now been updated to version 1.5.0.0, I have not returned to the game to track these bugs to see if they are still present.

| With a secondary weapon equipped, save and quit the game. |
| When you reload, your secondary weapons health reduces to an almost broken state. |
| Easy to replicate with these steps and is applicable to any weapon equipped in the secondary slot. |

| When killing a hidden Factory puppet hanging from the ledge, if they immediately die from an attack and drop an item, the item will remain suspended in the air, making it unreachable. |
| The video cuts out too early, but I did try to retrieve the item from the rooftop where the enemy was hanging. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. |



## Episode 3

| Description |

| After breaking the Flame Golem puppet out of its aggro range, which is the stairs behind it, the enemy will continue to attack. This is not an issue in these types of games, as enemies are designed to keep attacking if you're within their engagement range. |
| The issue lies in the enemy's inability to pursue you onto the steel beams. Video evidence shows that you can effectively cheese what is supposed to be a challenging mid-level enemy. Your only challenge is exercising patience. |



## Episode 4
### Incorrect King of Riddles subtitles

| Description |
| :-- |
| The second block of subtitles, which reads "See for yourself. I sell only the best treasure," does not match what The Riddler is saying. The third block returns to the correct text. |
| Given what this incorrect text says, I assume that it overlapped with a trader in the same area. |
| Either this was a one-off bug, or it has been patched in version 1.2 because it did not occur again during my second playthrough. |

| Description |
| :-- |
| While battling the Hammer Fist Carcass, the enemy's heavy attack knocked me into a corner that I couldn't escape from, thanks to the walls, objects to my left, and the size of the enemy. |
| Additionally, my weapon being large and having a wide arcing swing meant that I couldn't effectively attack, leaving me with nothing to do other than perfect guard or die. |
| Strictly, this is not a bug. I discuss it further in the blog section towards the bottom of this page |



## Episode 6

| The flame-wrecking ball environmental hazard can be easily avoided by successfully triggering a backstab animation on the flamethrower puppet. |
| P is invincible for the entire duration of this animation. |
| This too is not a bug. I discuss this further in the blog section and give my thoughts on the developer's decision to patch it. |



## Episode 7
### Failed enemy stagger

| Description |
| :-- |
| When the enemy's health bar becomes surrounded by a white flickering border, this indicates that they can be staggered by a charged heavy attack. You can achieve this by holding down the heavy attack button which for controller is RT or R2 depending on your preference. |
| I successfully executed this attack, and it did hit. The contact can be confirmed by the hit point damage numbers on the upper right of the health bar increasing, and the red meter decreasing, although the latter is less obvious. |
| The enemy should stagger into an idle state that allows me to perform a high-damage execution animation, similar to the backstab in episode 5. |
| This is the only time I had a fatal attack fail to stagger an enemy that had entered the stagger state. I can't say iframes caused it because the enemy receives the damage; I assume that changing its battle stance from single-wield to dual-wield cancelled the stagger. |



## Episode 8
### Enemies trapped in bottleneck

| Description |
| :-- |
| A group of Factory and Pitchfork puppets get trapped amongst themselves and the level geometry. The middle one stays in an idle animation while the other two, one on the left and one on the right, stay in their run animations. All three are trying to pursue me. |
| This bug lasts long enough for me to calmly observe, but it is not indefinite. Eventually, they do break out of their glitchy pathfinding and make their way to my weapon. |
| I reliably replicated this bug several times, but it's not 100% consistent and relies on the player rushing past immediate enemies to take out the Nothing up my hat Puppet first. |



## Episode 9
### Enemy corpse twitching in geometry

| Description |
| :-- |
| An enemy I had killed earlier got stuck in the level geometry, causing it to flail uncontrollably. |
| I had left the enemy, but upon returning, I found it still flailing about and that it had moved down the path where its legs were placed, all the way to the corner. |
| This glitch seemed to have no end in sight. I observed it for about 15 minutes before moving on. Resetting the area by dying or interacting with a Stargazer will fix this issue, as either of these actions respawns enemies in true Soulslike fashion. |


 

## Blog

### Episode 1
The severity level is **moderate** with a **medium** priority. Initially, I thought minor and low ratings were appropriate because of the situation that I discovered and showcased it in, and what must be done to find and replicate it; not many will find this. But upon further thinking, I realised how inconvenient this would be if I disconnected in the middle of a battle and loaded back in with an almost broken weapon. Thought must also be put into the fact that what else in the game could be potentially affected by a reload like this, so the nature of the bug should be explored deeper. I have to admit that I can't figure out what could be causing this to happen. I can't make a best guess because I have none. This is a bug that drives my want to work in the industry to understand how this happens and fills me with regret because I don't work in Neowiz.

### Episode 2
The severity level of this bug is **minor** with **low** priority. The problem is minimal because standard enemy drops are single use consumables that P can use to remove aliments, temporarily enhance weapons and resistances, and upgrade weapon blades. Additionally, these drops are random chance and not guaranteed.

### Episode 3
The severity level of this issue is considered **minor** with **low** priority. It can be challenging to lure this enemy up the stairs. In this recording, it was my second attempt at doing so, as I failed to exercise patience the first time. Strangely, the enemy wouldn't even approach the stairs after multiple attempts. I'm unsure why he was less resistant to it the first time. Additionally, it's worth noting that this enemy is not a mandatory fight; you can choose to skip it entirely. However, defeating him does yield an equipment item.

### Episode 4
If this issue remained unfixed and/or was constant, I would assign it a **moderate** severity level but with **low** priority. I raise the severity level because of the potential complications players who are hard of hearing may experience, as well as players who rely on subtitles. I cannot test this in foreign languages, but I would assume that all languages were affected by this.

### Episode 5
This situation had me conflicted because there is no actual bug; everything is intentional and part of the game's design. The enemy is outside of its aggro range, but I remained in its battle range, so I can't rightfully label it as a bug. However, I always analyze everything as a tester, even when performing a specific task that tests functionality; I also evaluate other aspects like visuals and level design. For me, this is a minor level design issue. The box to the left should be moved slightly so that the player can escape. But this is a very specific situation to be caught in. Even if I had a different weapon equipped, I might have been able to defeat the enemy, assuming I'm not hindered by a lack of user skill.
I wasn't going to put this one up at all but I think it opens up good grounds for debate amongst testers, developers and end users alike.

### Episode 6
This is another ground for debate issue. This like episode 4 is not a bug, iframes are an intentional part of this game and are regularly seen in use during combat when you correctly time your dodge rolls, when you backstab any enemy or when you open any door that triggers an animation. All this succeeded in doing was greatly elevating my heart rate due to the fear it instilled in me, it was very sudden and very loud.

I wasn't going to publish this episode, but as of version 1.2, Neowiz has indeed patched it. The ball doesn't trigger until you move much closer to the bridge seen at the end of the scene. However, this change has a downside: the ball can now be seen well in advance and is easily avoidable as a result. Balancing this environmental hazard seems to be a tricky endeavour, one that I would particularly enjoy working on actively. Its severity would have to be rated as minor with low priority, as the instances from both pre and post-patch are not strictly bugs, nor do they break any kind of immersion.

### Episode 7
This is a challenging issue, but at least we're back to dealing with bugs. If it occurred more than once in all my playthroughs, I'd give it a moderate or even major severity level with a medium priority due to how it can negatively impact a tough fight for the end user. However, considering its extreme rarity, I would have to rate it as having **minor** severity but with a **medium** priority. My reasoning for increasing its priority is due to not discounting the possibility that this bug could occur more frequently once it's in the hands of the masses.

### Episode 8
While some bugs are minor and humorous it's important to remain professional and report them, even if they can resolve themselves something like this can easily break a player's immersion. Severity is **minor** and priority is **low**.

### Episode 9
I would rate this issue with a **minor** severity and **low** priority due to its rarity and its lack of interference with the functionality of the game. The primary problem it presents is that it breaks immersion.
