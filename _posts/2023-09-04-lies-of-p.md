This season of Lies of P will highlight the bugs and glitches I discovered on my first playthrough and following two completion runs. Throughout my play time lifecycle the game was patched once moving it from version 1.1.0.0 to version 1.2.0.0.

## Episode 1
### Floating Item Drop
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.1 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2PiGcFCYAM?si=5E1mYBQs2DlEE3M9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* On killing a hidden enemy hanging from a ledge, if they immediately die from an attack and drop an item, the item will remain suspended in the air leaving it unreachable.
* The video cuts out too early but I did try to retieve the item from the rooftop the enemy was hanging from, I was unsuccessful.

The severity level of this is **minor** with **low** priority thanks to the fact that standard enemy drops are one time use consumables that P can use to remove aliments, temporarily enhance weapons and resistances, and upgrade weapon blades. Furthermore these drops are random chance and not guaranteed.



## Episode 2
### Enemy Agro Distance Exceeded
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.1 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Dg6SLYZpoI?si=U9RuoGG01nfLQE9V" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* After breaking the enemy out of it's agro range which is the stairs behind it, the enemy will continue to attack. This is not an issue in these kind of games as enemies are designed to keep attacking if you're within their engagement range.
* The issue lies in the enemies inability to pursue you onto the steel beams, video evidence shows you can effectively cheese what is supposed to be a difficult mid level enemy, your only challenge is exercising patience.

The severity level of this is **minor** with **low** priority, it is quite difficult to get this enemy up the stairs. This recording was my second attempt at this after I failed to exercise patience the first time, the enemy wouldn't even touch the stairs after multiple attempts. I have no idea why he was less resistent to it the first time. This enemy is also not a forced fight he can be skipped entirely but he does drop a useful equipment item on defeat.



## Episode 3
### Incorrect Riddler Subtitles
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.1 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5fp05MaDTg?si=IE5Qw_x67jT9cSfN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* The second block of subtitles which reads "See for yourself. I sell only the best treasure" does not match what The Riddler is saying. The third block returns to the correct text.
* Given what this incorrect text says my assumption is that it overlaped from a trader in the same area.
* Either this was a once off bug or its been patched in version 1.2 because it did not occur again on my second playthrough.

If this remained unfixed and/or was constant I would give it a **moderate** severity level but with a **low** priority. My reasoning for bumping up its severity level is due to the complications players that are hard of hearing may experience or players who are dependent on subtitles, I'm unable to test this in foreign languages but I would assume that all languages were impacted by this.



## Episode 4 
### Trapped in the Corner
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.1 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDqaqfr3b6M?si=bFE_3J9Jao9-2HQz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* While battling a tough mid level enemy, the enemies heavy attack knocked me into a corner that I couldn't escape from thanks to the walls, object top my left and the size of the enemy.
* Addtionally, my weapon being large and having a wide arching swing meant that I couldn't effectively attack leaving me with nothing to do other than perfect guard or die.

This one had me conflicted because there is no actual bug, everything is intentional and part of the games design. The enemy is outside of its argo range but I remained in its battle range so I can't rightfully label that a bug. But I will always be a tester that analises everything even doing a specific task that tests functionality I would also be rating other aspects like visuals and level design. For me this is a minor level design issue, the box to the left should be moved away just enough so that the player can escape. But this is a very specific situation to be caught in, even if I had a different weapon equipped I may have been able to defeat the enemy assuming I'm not held back by a user skill issue.
I wasn't going to put this one up at all but I think it opens up good grounds for debate amongst testers, developers and end users.



## Episode 5 
### Wrecking Ball Invinciblity Frames
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.1 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBsIaITJMxE?si=Rie5mZOU692pCvJ-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* The flame wrecking ball environmental hazard is easily avoided by successfully triggering a backstab animation on the flamethrower enemy.
* Pis invincible for the entire duration of this animation.

This is another grounds for debate issue. This like episode 4 is not a bug, iframes are intentional part of this game and are regularly seen in use during combat when you correctly time your dodge rolls. All this succeeded in doing was greatly elevating my heartrate due to the fear it instilled in me, it was very sudden and very loud get off my back.

Again I wasn't going to publish this episode but as of version 1.2 Neowiz have indeed patched it. The ball doesn't trigger until you move a lot closer to the bridge seen a the end of the scene. However, this now has a downside, the ball can now be seen well in advance and is easily avoidable as a result. Balancing this environmental harzard seems to be a tricky endeavour one that I would particularly enjoy being able to actively work on. It's severity would have to be **minor** with a **low** priority as the instances from both pre and post patch are not strictly bugs nor do they break any kind of immersion.



## Episode 6
### Failed Enemy Stagger
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.1 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HROmxFV_fhg?si=YDdC35r8V0_7u2HR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* When the enemies health bar becomes surrounded by a white flickering border this indicates that they can be staggered by a charged up heavy attack. This is achieved by holding down the heavy attack button.
* I successfully execute this attack and it does hit. The contact can be confirmed by the hit point damage numbers on the upper right of the health bar inceasing and the red meter decreasing though the latter is less obvious. 
* The enemy should stagger into an idol state that allows me to perform a high damage execution animation similar to the backstab in episode 5 
* This is the one and only time I had a fatal attack fail to stagger an enemy that entered the stagger state. I can't say iframes caused it because the enemy recieves the damage, my assumption is it changing its battle stance from single wield to dual-wield cancelled the stagger.

This is a tough one but at least we're back to bugs, if it occurred more than once in all my playthroughs I'd give it a moderate or even major severity level with a medium priority due to how it can negatively impact a tough fight for the end user. But considering its extreme rarity I would have to give it **low** severity but with a **medium** priority, my reasoning for moving up its priority is down to me not discounting that fact that this bug could occurr a lot more than I would percieve once it's in the hands of the masses.



## Episode 7
### Enemies Trapped in Bottleneck
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.2 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_lIhI-S_ZM?si=CiC6kcGKpH0zYvQg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* A group of enemies get trapped amongst themselves and the level geometry. The middle one stays in an idol animation while the other two, one on the left and one on the right, stay in their run animations, all three are trying to pursue me.
* This bug lasts long enough to calmly observe but it is not indefinite, they do break out of their glitchy path finding and find there way to my weapon.
* I also failed to repicate it after multiple attempts.

While some bugs are minor and humorous it's important to remain professional and report them, even if they can resolve themselves something like this can easily break a players immersion. Severity is **minor** and priority is **low**.



## Episode 8
### Enemy Corpse Twitching in Geometery
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.2 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/70hpnVIKWKo?si=CMag1mt3n06xvEfV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
* An enemy I had killed earlier managed to get stuck in the level geometery causing it to flail about uncontrollably.
* I had left the enemy but upon returning I found it still flailing about and that it had moved down the path that it's legs lay over all the way to the corner.
* This glitch seem to have no end in sight, I observed it for around 15 minutes before moving on. Resetting the area by dying or interacting with a Stargazer will fix this issue because either of these actions respawn enemies in true soulslike fashion.

I would give this a **minor** severity with a **low** priority due to its rarity and it's lack of interference with the functionality of the game. The main problem presented is immerson breaking.
