This is a free-to-play puzzle game with a golf aesthetic that runs on a one-tap mechanic, making it a highly accessible game. It hits a lot of notes in my "usable by, regardless of" philosophy. It is a simple but fun game with lots of cool additional features, like its own in-game currency that you earn through gameplay, which you can use to unlock different ball and tether colours. Speaking of which, let's go to the first episode.

| On opening the tools menu, you land on the page where you can purchase different ball colours. |
| You can then navigate to tether colours, but once you open this screen, you can't return to the previous screen. |
| You can exit the tools menu and do other actions like continue play. |
| The only way to open up the ball colour screen again is to close the game and restart. |
| This bug is easy to reproduce. |

### Episode 1
The bug severity is trivial with a low priority level. I've rated it so low with no real need to rush and fix because it doesn't break any important aspects of the game, like being able to continue playing levels. If the in-game currency was purchased using real money, I would then put it to a moderate priority level so people don't assume that their transaction was affected. However, I would leave its severity at trivial because it is causing zero damage to the system and is at best causing minor confusion to any players.
