This first season of Payday 3 will showcase all the bugs and glitches I find while playing the game. My hope with Payday 3 in particular is to pick up on bugs that come about from running over a network on a server with multiple end users. So far this is proving difficult due to finding friends that are willing to play on a regular basis, there's too many good games out as of writing this.

## Episode 1
### Awkward User Interface
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.0.0.0624677 <br>

Description:
* After inviting a friend to your heist party the cursor moves to the bottom of your friends list located on the left side automatically. This is very frustrating to deal with everytime you play with friends, it would be worse if the game had more than four players.
* Another justifiable nitpick is the options bar that runs along the bottom of the screen, the LS and RS shuold be swapped around, I have instinctively went to click on LS to invite to party solely because it's the first thumbstick option when reading from left to right which the majority of humans do.
* Furthermore, the ability to remove and block players shouldn't be so easily accessable, people on these lists tend to be friends afterall. But that's not to say the feature should be removed, it should be hidden behind a sub menu that you may access by pushing in the left stick. 

The severity level of this bug is **minor** but should have a **medium** priority. It is by no means a game breaking bug but we can't discount how inconvenient this bug is particularly for those who have large friends lists. Being at the bottom of your offline friends and having needlessly navigate through both them and your general online friends before reaching the list of friends that are in Payday 3 can be enough to put people off playing with friends and going to public lobbys, playing alone or not playing at all. The last option could be grounds to move the priorty level to high despite the severity level being minor.



## Episode 2
### Lost Loot Bag
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.0.0.0624677 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/93fXeVJI1bo?si=vLwDTrsi_uxxSF2I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Description:
* A result of extemely bad timing, as the video shows the door closes on me and the bag gets snagged on the helicopter. The bag then disappears when it is carried past the invisible wall that the player cannot pass.
* It's difficult to 100% confirm that the bag completely vanished because we didn't get all the bags thanks to being perma locked out of a room that contained an additional piece of loot, it can only be accessed using a bank employee hostage preferably in stealth.
* On a following run of the misson where combat was initiated again we did get all but one bag out where in the prior mission run we got all but two out. This gives me confidence that the bag did disappear but I can't assume that we definitely didn't miss a bag. 
* More supporting evidence is that the voice over lady confirms my colleagues bag was collected when she says "that's two" but she doesn't say that's three for my bag. She does count all the bags up to ten across all missions, the fact that she doesn't go past ten may indeed be an audio bug.

The severity level of this bug is **minor** with a **low** priority. It's a really difficult bug to catch in the first place nevermind replicate, it's the only mission where your transport gets chased away to somewhere further away thanks to pressure from the police. There is no visible timer to work with in an attempt to more relably replicate it.



## Episode 3
### Lost Loot Bag
Platform: Xbox Series X <br>
Firmware version number: <br>
Software version number: 1.0.0.0624677 <br>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9Bj8Iw3u5I?si=x_skM-IKAyqAg33k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Description:
* The riot shield enemy gets zipped back up to the floor above twice before settling on the same floor as me. 
* The most likely problem is miscommunication between the client and server where either packages from the server to the client got lost or vice versa. To me it looks like the server did not get confirmation from the client that the enemy had landed and reinitiated the action causing the enemy to pulled back up and dropped again.

The Severity level of this bug is **minor** with a **low** priority. Online gaming is ever an entity that can throw issues out when tampered with in any way, like a game of whack-a-mole fixing one problem can produce several more, I know this is programming in general but I feel this is especially problematic for online play. I'll stick by the levels I gave it but I would likely encourage using the Ostrich Algorithm with this and simply ignore it rather than risk causing more issues unless there are multiple small patches needed and this can be fit in to a sprint. Futhermore, these glitches don't appear that often in the game overall and can add to the chaos that the shootouts in this game aims for.
