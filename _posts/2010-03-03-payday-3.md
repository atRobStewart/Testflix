This first season of Payday 3 will showcase all the bugs and glitches I find while playing the game. My particular focus with Payday 3 is to identify bugs that may arise when playing on a network server with multiple end users. However, so far, this has proven to be difficult due to the challenge of finding friends willing to play regularly, especially with so many good games available at the time of writing.



## Episode 1 & 1.5
### Awkward User Interface

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software       | Area of Interest |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Xbox Series X | 10.0.25398.1762 | 1.0.0.0624677  | Friends List UI  |

| Minor            | Low                | Cosmetic         | Medium             |

| After inviting a friend to your heist party, the cursor automatically moves to the bottom of your friends list on the left side. This can be very frustrating to deal with every time you play with friends, and it would become even more challenging if the game had more than four players. |
| Another justifiable nitpick is the options bar that runs along the bottom of the screen. The LS and RS should be swapped around. I've instinctively tried to click on LS to invite to the party because it's the first thumbstick option when reading from left to right, which the majority of humans do. |
| Furthermore, the ability to remove and block players shouldn't be so easily accessible, as people on these lists tend to be friends, after all. But that's not to say the feature should be removed; it should be hidden behind a sub-menu that you can access by pressing in the left stick. |



## Episode 2
### Lost Loot Bag

| Platform      | Firmware        | Software       | Mission   | Difficulty      |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Xbox Series X | 10.0.25398.1762 | 1.0.0.0624677  | Dirty Ice | Normal          |

| Bug Severity | Priority level |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Minor        | Low            |

| Due to extremely bad timing, as the video shows, the door closes on me, and the bag gets snagged on the helicopter. The bag then disappears when it is carried past the invisible wall that the player cannot pass. |
| It's difficult to 100% confirm that the bag completely vanished because we didn't collect all the bags, partly due to being permanently locked out of a room that contained an additional piece of loot. This room can only be accessed using a bank employee hostage, preferably in stealth. |
| In a subsequent run of the mission where combat was initiated again, we collected all but one bag, whereas in the previous mission run, we collected all but two. This gives me confidence that the bag did disappear, but I can't definitively say that we didn't miss a bag. |
| More supporting evidence is that the voice-over lady confirms my colleague's bag was collected when she says "That's two" but she doesn't say that's three for my bag. She does count all the bags up to ten across all missions, the fact that she doesn't go past ten may indeed be an audio bug. |

### Y Axis Challenged Enemy

| The riot shield enemy gets zipped back up to the floor above twice before settling on the same floor as me. |
| The most likely problem is miscommunication between the client and server where either packages from the server to the client got lost or vice versa. To me, it looks like the server did not get confirmation from the client that the enemy had landed and reinitiated the action causing the enemy to get pulled back up and dropped again. |

### Episode 1 & 1.5
The severity level of this bug is **minor** but should have a **medium** priority. It is by no means a game-breaking bug but we can't discount how inconvenient this bug is particularly for those who have large friends lists. Being at the bottom of your offline friends and having needlessly navigate through both them and your general online friends before reaching the list of friends that are in Payday 3 can be enough to put people off playing with friends and going to public lobbies, playing alone or not playing at all. The last option could be grounds to move the priority level to high despite the severity level being minor.

The options bar should have a **medium** priority. I shouldn't give it a bug severity level because it is not strictly a bug it's just questionable UI design, but if I had to I'd give it the lowest level of **cosmetic**. But it does need a medium priority because it is too easy to accidentally delete a friend with the invite option being on the opposite stick.

### Episode 2
The severity level of this bug is **minor** with a **low** priority. It's a really difficult bug to catch in the first place never mind replicate. It's also the only mission where your transport gets chased away to somewhere further away thanks to pressure from the police. There is no visible timer to work with in an attempt to more reliably replicate it.

### Episode 3
The severity level of this bug is **minor** with a **low** priority. Online gaming is often an unpredictable entity that can generate issues when tampered with in any way. Fixing one problem can sometimes lead to several more, and while this is a common challenge in programming, it can be especially problematic for online play. I'll stand by the levels I gave it, but I would likely encourage using the Ostrich Algorithm with this and simply ignore it rather than risk causing more issues unless multiple small patches are needed and this can be added into a sprint. Furthermore, these glitches don't appear that often in the game overall and can add to the chaos that the shootouts in this game aim for.
