Just one episode for Starfield so far and I fear it'll remain like this for quite some time, maybe indefinitely. To credit the game it's the least buggy Bethesda main studio offering I've ever seen at launch, but there are simply too many better games that I can play and test currently, and in spite of what I said bugs in these games are low-hanging fruit. I put 25 hours into this game before it became too boring and the call of better games got to me, see Lies of P.

Description:
* When an interaction is initiated, the game comes to a standstill until you leave the conversation.
* If you have an AI companion, they will also freeze and not catch up to you or be teleported close to you off-camera.
* When they partake in the conversation, your camera switches to them, which is expected. However, it looks out of place when they are a floor below you, and you see them looking up at you through the floor.
* The NPC you're primarily speaking to looks a bit off when he moves his gaze from your companion back to you.

I'd have to give this a severity level of minor with a low priority. As far as Bethesda's main studio games go this is a very minor and small issue, but it doesn't take away from how unprofessional it looks from a highly reputed AAA studio. Furthermore, bugs like this shouldn't exist on a game they claim is 20-plus years in the making and is using what looks like a barely updated version of the engine they used to make all their games from Oblivion onwards. This game should be fine-tuned to the absolute last with bugs both big and small very few a far between, they've been working with this tech since 2006.
